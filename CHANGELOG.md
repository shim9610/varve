# Changelog

All notable repository releases are documented here. Varve follows semantic
versioning; while the crates remain below 1.0, incompatible Rust API changes
increment the minor version.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Required declaration-time `ReadLimits` with generated bounded open/read APIs
  and visibly named trusted-unbounded escape hatches.
- Open-object snapshot reads for native and custom layouts, preserving file
  identity and validated logical EOF across pathname replacement.
- Matrix, sidecar, mmap, index, scan, payload, and cumulative materialization
  limits enforced before claim-sized allocation.
- ASan-backed arbitrary-byte fuzz targets for native, codec, custom-layout, and
  matrix-plus-sidecar paths, plus strict Miri and Windows `ReplaceFileW` fault
  tests.
- `PublishedButRebindFailed` for the explicit state where copy-on-write
  publication succeeded but the writer could not bind to the new generation.

### Changed

- `replace_fixed` now uses copy-on-write publication. The former safe
  `ReplaceStrategy::FixedInPlace` variant was removed; the lower-copy operation
  is available only through `unsafe replace_fixed_in_place_exclusive`.
- Canonical decoding now rejects duplicate variable fields, nonzero field
  flags, noncanonical map order, duplicate map keys, and trailing internal
  envelope bytes.
- `HashMap<K, V>` decoding requires `K: Ord` so canonical key order can be
  validated.
- Native recovery distinguishes incomplete tails from fatal corruption and
  resource-limit failures.
- Merge and compact use bounded snapshot reads and shared atomic publication.

### Compatibility

- Existing valid 0.1 native wire bytes and schema hashes are preserved; no file
  migration is required solely for this release.
- Source users must add a complete `limits` declaration or `ReadLimits`, migrate
  fixed replacement calls, and satisfy the canonical map bound where relevant.
